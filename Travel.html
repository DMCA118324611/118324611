            <p>I have been to France twice. My grand aunt owns a house in the south of France, in the town of Colliure. The scenery there is breathtaking, being below the pyrennes mountains
            and being situated on the coast, which hosts numerous beautiful beaches. We also visited the castle at Carcassone. It is a perfectly preserved medieval town in the south of France.
            We were lucky enough to witness a medieval jousting tournament. Inside the walls of the castle there is many medieval themed shops and restaurant's.
            You could also visit the perfectly preserved castle armoury and Throne room.</p>

            plenty to see and do such as the Santiago Bernabeau, Madrid Bullring, Toledo, The retiro park and the nighttime atmosphere in the place de sol. </p>
